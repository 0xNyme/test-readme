Introduction to Rust Programming Language
Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and data races through its strong type system and ownership model.
Rust was first released in 2010 and has quickly gained popularity among developers for its emphasis on reliability and performance. Its unique ownership model helps manage memory efficiently and eliminates entire classes of bugs at compile time. Rust is used in a variety of domains, from embedded systems to web development, and is backed by a vibrant and growing community.
Key Features

Memory Safety: Rust ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
Performance: Rust programs run fast and are suitable for system-level development.
Concurrency: Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs safely.
Modern Syntax: Rust offers expressive and clean syntax.
Zero-Cost Abstractions: Rust provides high-level abstractions without runtime overhead.
Pattern Matching: Rust’s powerful pattern matching simplifies control flow and data handling.
Ecosystem and Tooling: Rust’s Cargo package manager and build tool streamline dependency management and project workflows.

Example
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}

Another Example
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let sum = add(5, 7);
    println!("The sum is: {}", sum);
}

Advanced Example with Pattern Matching
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Write(String),
}

fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quitting..."),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Writing: {}", text),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::Write(String::from("Hello, Rust!"));
    process_message(msg);
}

Rust is ideal for building reliable and efficient software.
