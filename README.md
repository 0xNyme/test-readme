# Introduction to Rust Programming Language

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and data races through its strong type system and ownership model.

## Key Features

- **Memory Safety:** Rust ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
- **Performance:** Rust programs run fast and are suitable for system-level development.
- **Concurrency:** Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs safely.
- **Modern Syntax:** Rust offers expressive and clean syntax.

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

Rust is ideal for building reliable and efficient software.
